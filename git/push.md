####ERROR:
So this is the error which I faced when I tried to push my github repository to a new repo. 

PS C:\Users\admin\Desktop\Code-blunders> git push -u origin main 
To https://github.com/ChristopherTechn/code-blunders.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/ChristopherTechn/code-blunders.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. If you want to integrate the remote changes,
hint: use 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.


###FIX
So I faced the error because my local main branch is behind the remote main branch on GitHub — maybe GitHub has a README.md, .gitignore, or something else you didn’t have locally.

so I run:
 git pull origin main --rebase 
git push -u origin main 

it worked correctly and the error was fixed.
